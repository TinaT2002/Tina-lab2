		<h2>WHY IS THIS MY FAVORITE SHOW</h2>
		<p>This has been my favorite show since 2020. It is about a young boy who doesnt want to be like his father.However after his father passing he soon turned out to be just like him and continues to sell drugs. This show keeps me on my toes and is very unpredicatable which is enjoy a lot. Also majority of the cast are African American which i can realate to and i like seeing people of my cultural backround.</p>
